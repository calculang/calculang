# Contributing

This page contains some information about developing for calculang internals 🔧

If you are keen to help the project in some other way or are unsure how, feel free to get in touch with me! 😃

## monorepo

calculang repository is a monorepo, using [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage multiple packages.

For an overview of all packages, see the [calculang `/packages` folder](/packages).

## build

1. clone `https://github.com/calculang/calculang`
2. run `yarn` to install required packages
3. `yarn run build` to build all packages
4. `yarn run bootstrap` to bootstrap packages (install dependencies and link cross-dependencies)
5. `yarn run test` to run the tests

## on licensing, for contributions/pull requests

Please see [inbound=outbound](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) clause of GitHub Terms of Service and [license](./LICENSE.md) (AGPLv3).

Please talk to me if there are any doubts about the rights to your contribution, or about the project license.

## open issues

If you are willing to work on an open issue (and confident), please comment in the issue.

## major changes

Please open a public discussion via a GitHub Issue first. Please include if you wish/are prepared to be assigned to the issue.

## continuous integration (CI)

todo setup automated jest tests via GitHub Actions, so that pull requests are tested automatically and reported in PR.

Of course, contributions should include new tests where relevant and be checked by developer to pass. But I will setup CI just in case 😏 (or because of humans :smile_cat:).
