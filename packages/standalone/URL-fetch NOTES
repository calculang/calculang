There are 2 levels of support for URLs

1. you can point to a URL as entrypoint, it will make fetches and compile
  - this is convenient e.g. can help me to do many tests (not sure if ideal though)
  - already working except for modular

2. you can point to a URL in any cul import
  - this permits overriding a model in the console for demo - but anyplace (emphasizes transparency, portability, modularity, formula reuse)
  - This is harder. The references after pointing to a URL should resolve relative to that URL, which can be scope-dependent and should come from parent scope
  - this lets me REALLY test/demo things

To implement 2 consider cheap/shallow integration. Cheap=just a new pass (new fs0) should work.
Possibly DX by (entrypoint or fs) => resolved fs. LATER consider if really needs to be new pass
