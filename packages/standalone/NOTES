In ImportDeclaration I include 'local renames' for specifiers: This is necessary for threading I guess, but it's a FALSE FRIEND (or at least incomplete) for doing import X as X_orig: KEEP DOING import X_ as X_orig

AND I must ONLY do the _ as thing IF I WILL HAVE A NEW DEFINITION TO REPLACE IT (or rename will not happen)

DEV PLAN

making pre_introspection pass to do:
  - ~~build of cul_scope_ids_to_resource~~
  - init of fs0
    - if poss do fetching to populate fs

after pass then do depth-first:
  - populate fs1. Apply applicable `replacements` (at first none)
  - construct function list by calling introspection with fs1 but pointing to X
  - Populate cul_scope_id -> array of names into `replacements`

make fs1 = make all_cul replacements
